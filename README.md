# RBRPlugins

This is a personal plugin set for Richard Burns Rally that making a more easy use.

Big thanks to [mika-n](https://github.com/mika-n) that made the [NGPCarMenu](https://github.com/mika-n/NGPCarMenu) plugin and [RBRCountdown](https://github.com/HanaMcHanaface/RBRCountdown.git) that this plugin is based on. If it wasn't for NGPCarMenu I would never have been able to make this plugin. Big huge shoutout!!
